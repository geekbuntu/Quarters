stuff for now
rename pkgname to package in PROTOCOL
need to read important things like arch from PKGBUILD, using namcap to properly determine what to do, and will be used for the next step
add a custom repo for rebuilds

stuff for later
find out if current devtools set chroot barrier. if not patch them so that we don't have to worry about it in quarters
