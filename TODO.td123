stuff for now
*** need to download src pkgs from "remote" to master_root/new_ujid/new_ujid.src.tar.gz
*** or need to put the src.tar.gz packages directly into master_root/new_ujid/new_ujid.src.tar.gz
clean up code
work on package fetching

stuff for later
find out if current devtools set chroot barrier. if not patch them so that we don't have to worry about it in quarters
