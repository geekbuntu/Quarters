Required dependencies:
extra/devtools - for building in a clean chroot environment
AUR: python3-tornado-git - for the web server
community/python-yaml - for reading configs

For webui.py
AUR: python3-pymongo
AUR: python-bottle

Adapt your configuration (conf/quarters.conf)
Make sure that the master and the builders are configured correctly
Start buildermaster
use curl http://MASTERSERVER:MASTERPORT/global_status (e.g. curl http://localhost:1337/global_status)
you should receive something like: {"0": "notdone"}

To add a job to the master, you can emulate a builder using the following
url:
curl http://MASTERSERVER:MASTERPORT/job
you should something like receive: {"ujid": "0", "architecture": "x86_64", 
"package_name": "datavisualizationapp", "sha256sum": "sha256sumgoeshere"}
the job is now added to the queue
run it again, you should get: NOJOBS

To build this job with the builder, you need to re-start the master, and then
start the builder. Because the builder uses chroots, it is necessary, 
that you add appropriate permissions to your sudo (something like:
NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/makechrootpkg, /usr/sbin/mkarchroot, 
/usr/bin/chrootupdate, /usr/bin/extra-i686-build, /usr/bin/extra-x86_64-build).
