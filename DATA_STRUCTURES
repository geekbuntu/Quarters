All major data structures used by the https communication medium need to be documented here for consistancy.
Shrinking data sructures will usually require api changes, announce changes here before shrinking
Expanding is ok, just add more to the dicts

Master state structure:
server - Master
http location - /master_state.qjz
{}

Builder assignment structure:
server - Master
http location - /build/<builder key>.qjz
[{'pkgname': <package name>,
  'srcpkg': <url to scr.pkg on the master>}, ...]

Builder State structure:
server - Builder
http location - /builder_state.qjz
{'key': 'random key generated when the builder starts',
 'chroots': int(<number of chroots>),
 'building: [<pkgname>, ...]',
 ready {'package name': {
            'pkgurl: <url>',
            'sha256sum': <pkg sum>,
            'status': 'fail'/'stall'/'ready'}, ...}
