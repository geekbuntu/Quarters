late night talks about our protocol

http ports:
master - 1337
builder - 1338

worker protocol is pretty much done
================= /worker/ ====================
ujid = unique job id, no two jobs will ever have the same ujid

used to check up on progress
/global_status
{
 <ujid> : <status - notdone,inprogress,done,failed>,
 ...
}

if done provide the following interface:
/ujid/list_of_packages
[
 {
  pkgname : "a.pkg.tar.xz",
  sha256sum : <sha256sum>
 }
 ...
]

if done, also provide a way to access the built packages.
/ujid/a.pkg.tar.xz

if done, also provide the full build log
/ujid/build_log

==================/server/====================
returns a job from a pool and removes it from its internal list of unassigned jobs
/job
{
 'pkgname': <name>,
 ‘sha256sum’: <srcpkgsum>,
 'architecture': <i686,x86_64,any>
 'ujid': <some cool random num, like a shasum with padding :P>
}

used to keep track of all the jobs handed out
/global_status
{
 <ujid> : <status - notdone,inprogress,done,failed,downloading,stop>,
 ...
}

if done provide the following interface:
/ujid/list_of_packages
[
 {
  pkgname : "a.pkg.tar.xz",
  sha256sum : <sha256sum>
 }
 ...
]

if done, also provide a way to access the built packages.
/ujid/a.pkg.tar.xz

if done, also provide the full build log
/ujid/build_log
